Thank you for the opportunity to interview with y'all. I did not have time to get to Phase 4, but Phases 1 through 3 have been implemented. I used an implementation very similar to this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZeCz_QOoXw. I built the app on Flask and used ngrok to tunnel from an AWS ec2 instance. 

Here are the links:
